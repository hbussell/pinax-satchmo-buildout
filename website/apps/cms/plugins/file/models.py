    Plugin for storing any type of file.
    
    Default template displays download link with icon (if available) and file size.
    
    Icons are searched for within <MEDIA_ROOT>/<CMS_FILE_ICON_PATH> 
    (CMS_FILE_ICON_PATH is a plugin-specific setting which defaults to "<CMS_MEDIA_PATH>/images/file_icons")
    with filenames of the form <file_ext>.<icon_ext>, where <file_ext> is the extension
    of the file itself, and <icon_ext> is one of <CMS_FILE_ICON_EXTENSIONS>
    (another plugin specific setting, which defaults to ('gif', 'png'))
    
    This could be updated to use the mimetypes library to determine the type of file rather than
    storing a separate icon for each different extension.
    
    The icon search is currently performed within get_icon_url; this is probably a performance concern.
